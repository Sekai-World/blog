This is a really interesting time point when I starts writing this blog post. As Sega is warning all users that talk about spoilers or card side stories, Sekai Viewer as probably the most popular game assets database is also affected. A DMCA notice can simply kill it, or is there still chance?

## The Launch of Sekai World Blog

I finally decided to have a separate blog only for Sekai Viewer related things. The name "Sekai World" comes from the organization name in GitHub which host the source code of Sekai Viewer. "World" is the English translation of "Sekai", also means that there will contain thing all about Project Sekai.

Before I used to post Sekai Viewer related things in my personally blog, but I find that it would be better to have them separated. Although I did not regularly update blog posts, it is still nice to have a place for it.

## The future of Sekai Viewer

### What is the hell a DMCA notice

DMCA, namely [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act), is a copyright law made by US government. It is made for protecting the intellectual properties, but it is always [abused](https://donotpay.com/learn/dmca-abuse/).

If a copyright owner finds the case of copyright infringement, he can send a DMCA take-down notice. In case of contents hosted in the Internet, the receiver is usually the host provider, and the domain owner. Usually the access to the contents will be blocked at first, after the case is resolved, the access to other contents without copyright infringement will be restored.

### Will Sekai Viewer be taken down

Yes, and no. If my current host provider reacts, there is a very high chance that you lose access to Sekai Viewer. But, DMCA has its weakness: it does not apply to all the world. Since it is an US law, it does not have any impacts on companies that is outside US, when they does not have bussiness in the US. To answer it short: Sekai Viewer may be taken down **at any time**, but can go live **at any time** either.

The worst case is that you may never see it again. But it does not matter, I will have my own way to fight against it.

### What if Sekai Viewer survives

I planned to bring more features to Sekai Viewer, including the always wanted Team Builder. Also, I'm going to abandon the material design, and brings a more modern and responsive design. This will take a pretty long time, probably months, but I hope I can finish it before the 2nd anniversary. I would be very glad if anyone can help me accelerating it.

## Final words

Sekai Viewer is there, and might be always there. Thanks for all of you who supports me, especially those financially. The future will always be brighter.
